    Welcome back to birding school! We're resuming bird lessons after a refreshing winter beak, and are
    happy to welcome back our talon-ted students.

    Today, we'll be practicing bird formations. The geese have already perfected the flying V formation,
    so we'll have to step up our game if we're going to maintain the pigeon's good reputation.
  - Use the mouse to place birds on the grid. Once you've placed everyone, we can go to the next lesson.
